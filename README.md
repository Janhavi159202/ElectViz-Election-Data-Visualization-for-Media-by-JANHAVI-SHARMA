🏥 Healthcare Insight: Emergency Care Performance Tracker
🌟 Project Overview
The Healthcare Insight Dashboard is a high-impact Power BI solution designed to provide a 360-degree view of Emergency Room (ER) operations. By transforming complex patient data into actionable insights, this tracker empowers healthcare providers to monitor performance, reduce wait times, and enhance patient care quality.

Originally developed as part of a study on healthcare expenditure and performance, this dashboard focuses on the critical intersection of operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Patient Volume: Analyzing a total of 9.216K patients with deep-dives into monthly and departmental trends.

Operational Efficiency: Real-time tracking of the Average Waiting Time (35.26 mins) to optimize ER throughput.

Patient Satisfaction: Monitoring quality of care through focused satisfaction score analysis.

Case Management: Overseeing a total of 480 active cases across the hospital network.

🧠 Core Analysis & Features
Departmental Referrals: Detailed breakdown of patient distribution across 8 departments, identifying high-demand areas like General Practice and Orthopedics.

Demographic Profiling: Interactive analysis by Gender (51% Female / 49% Male) and Age, allowing for specialized care strategies.

Trend Monitoring: Visualizing the patient journey from January to December to identify seasonal peaks and resource needs.

Granular Reporting: A comprehensive data table for individual patient tracking, including wait times and satisfaction levels.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Power BI Desktop: The primary platform for advanced data visualization and report creation.

Power Query: Used for robust data transformation and cleaning of the hospital ER dataset.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Implemented for calculating complex measures like Average Wait Times and Satisfaction Scores.

Data Modeling: Established efficient relationships between patient demographics, time, and departmental data.
